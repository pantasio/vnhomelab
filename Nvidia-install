Installation
Debian 9 "Stretch"
As of stretch, you don't need nvidia-xconfig anymore, and a xorg.conf file is not needed either in most situations. Also, the 340 series has been forked into its own series of packages to support older cards.

In some situations running nvidia-xconfig is still required for screen-locking and suspend/resume to work properly (922679 Xfce/lightdm/light-locker)


Version 390.48 (via stretch-backports)
For support of Geforce 4xx and higher GPUs Supported devices. For older devices, see Version 340.102 (legacy GPUs) and Version 304.135 (legacy GPUs).

Add stretch-backports to your /etc/apt/sources.list, for example:

# stretch-backports
deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main contrib non-free
Install Linux headers for the kernel you are using. If you are using the 4.9 Linux kernel in Debian Stretch:

# apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r|sed 's/[^-]*-[^-]*-//')
Or if you are using a Linux kernel from stretch-backports:

# apt-get install -t stretch-backports linux-headers-$(uname -r|sed 's/[^-]*-[^-]*-//')
Then we can install the package nvidia-driver.

# apt-get update
# apt-get install -t stretch-backports nvidia-driver 
DKMS will build the nvidia module for your system.
Restart your system to enable the nouveau blacklist.

Version 375.66
For support of ?GeForce 4xx and higher GPUs (supported devices). For older devices, see Version 340.105 (legacy GPUs) and Version 304.135 (legacy GPUs).

Add "contrib" and "non-free" components to /etc/apt/sources.list, for example:

# Debian 9 "Stretch"
deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian/ stretch main contrib non-free
Update the list of available packages. Install the appropriate linux-headers and kernel module packages:

# apt update
# apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r|sed 's/[^-]*-[^-]*-//') nvidia-driver
This will install the nvidia-driver package. DKMS will build the nvidia module for your system, via the nvidia-kernel-dkms package.

Restart your system to enable the nouveau blacklist.

Version 340.102 (legacy GPUs)
For support of GeForce 6xxx and 7xxx GPUs (supported devices).

# apt update
# apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r|sed 's/[^-]*-[^-]*-//') nvidia-legacy-340xx-driver
